# Undercovidreams

_Undercovidreams_ lets you empathize with other people's inner worlds
by listening to their voices telling their own dreams whilst immersing
yourself in a night sky full of stars.


# Concept

Undercovidreams is a night sky where each star is a dream collected in
Italy during the severe lockdown of 2020. By interrogating the stars
you can navigate the imagery of people who have suddenly found
themselves prisoners of an unexpected and frightening situation, who
have decided, however, to share with others the nocturnal elaborations
of their mind. In fact, what are dreams if not the stories, the
desires, the hopes, the fears, the emotions that, just like the stars,
guide those who care to decipher them?
