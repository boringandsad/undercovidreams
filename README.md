# Undercovidreams

_Undercovidreams_ lets you empathize with other people's inner worlds by listening to their voices telling their own dreams whilst immersing yourself in a night sky full of stars.

# Concept

Undercovidreams is a collective art project. It shows a night sky where each star is a dream collected in Italy during the severe lockdown of 2020 by people taking part to the project.

By interrogating the stars one can navigate the imagery of people who have suddenly found themselves prisoners of an unexpected and frightening situation, who have decided, however, to share with others the nocturnal elaborations of their mind. In fact, what are dreams if not the stories, the desires, the hopes, the fears, the emotions that, just like the stars, guide those who care to decipher them?
